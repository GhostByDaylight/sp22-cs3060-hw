{-
Write a Haskell program that prints the string “Hello, NAME, you are good.” where
NAME is your name. Note that you need to compile your .hs file to create an executable, using commands
like, “ghc -o myhi prog.hs” and then run the “myhi" executable. Submit a screenshot that shows the above
activities (which carries 5 points). Writing README carries 1 point.
